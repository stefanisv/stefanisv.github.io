									<p align="left">The COVID-19 pandemic has recently driven the development of computational frameworks for modeling its transmission dynamics in an attempt to provide policy makers a reliable system for decision making. However, classical agent-based models do not consider enough information and therefore cannot capture meaningful risk variables nor policy measures responses from population [3].On the other hand, classical network-based models cannot replicate people interactions in real scenarios. Current machine learning methods, conversely,show promising results by modelling network structures and dynamic behaviors of such complex systems as spatiotemporal chaotic systems [1].</p>
									<p align="left">Moreover, recently work onexploring epidemic threshold behavior using deep learning models promotes further research in time-varying and multiplex networks for model scalability [2]. In this research, we propose to develop a hybrid approach to representthe spatiotemporal dynamics of a pandemic spread, using graph neural networks to model the fine-grained data features and the people social responses from specific local conditions, capturing the heterogeneous social links on diffusion patterns. </p> 
								
									<p align="left"> Particularly, my work focuses on people distribution and mobility behaviour analysis along a specific space/time dimension. My recent poster describes the application of artificial neural networks, GNN + mRNN, to represent a heterogeneous population using symbolic metamodelling approaches to explain the epidemic transmission dependency between descriptors, presented at the 34th Conference on <a href="https://videos.neurips.cc/" target="_blank"> Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020) </a>, <a href="https://wimlworkshop.org/neurips2020/program/" target="_blank"> 15th Women in Machine Learning Workshop (WiML 2020)</a>.</p>

									<p align="left">Our globalised modern economy is quite susceptible to any local disruption that can impact all markets. In particular, epidemic outbreaks potentially mean a vulnerability for our society, due to international travel spreads infections faster than ever, public health system is under pressure in many countries with a limited ability to handle unexpected events that creates high patient numbers and a potential collapse of the whole system./p>
									<p align="left">Addressing this type of crisis requires a multidisciplinary approach and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable disease spreading approaches that illustrate real pandemic scenarios in order to deliver better policies. In this context, real-time analysis and interpretation of epidemic data is crucial to both the response itself and the modelling efforts aimed at improving that response./p> 
								
									<p align="left">In this project, we propose to develop a hybrid model that incorporate the best of computational models and epidemic data analysis: a network- and agent-based system that can simulate more realistic population behaviours. This research will enable a unified understating of epidemic data in real time to support decision-making actions within the community. A key contribution of this project would be the use of realistic epidemic parameters to estimate, visualise and communicate the uncertainty in complex epidemic models.</p>
									
								<h3>Outcomes</h3>
									<ul align="left">
										<li>Simulation of complex real populations behaviour in a pandemic scenario, when crucial data is unreliable or unavailable, through the development of a hybrid network- and agent-based model.</li>
										<li>Implementation of realistic mobility patterns approach by considering working with arbitrary parameters and trying to reproduce observed behaviours.</li>
										<li>Framework for policies implementation assessment.</li>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/clinical.png" alt="" /></span>My work integrates phylogenetic comparative methods and functional morphology to study macroevolutionary patterns in fishes. My dissertation takes advantage of new methodology,  the largest vertebrate body shape dataset ever constructed, and classic biomechanical principles to explore the effects of transitions to biting feeding modes on the morphological diversity of reef fishes.</p>
								<p>In recent work, with <a href="https://fishmorph.com">Chris Martinez</a> and Peter Wainwright, I used landmark morphometrics to quantify cranial kinesis as a trajectory of skull shape change during the feeding strike, then used macroevolutionary models to estimate the evolutionary dynamics of feeding kinematics. We contrasted the evolutionary dynamics of feeding mechanics and morphology between fishes that exclusively capture prey with suction and multifunctional species that augment suction feeding with biting behaviors to remove attached benthic prey. We found evidence for reduced kinesis in fishes that rely on biting and that among suction feeders, prey type may affect evolution of skull mobility. Ultimately, we found that multifunctionality constrains rates of kinematic evolution in biters, but not the evolution of head shapes. </p>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/progression.png" alt="" /></span>I have spent parts of two summers in the fish collections at the Smithsonian Institution with a joint team out of the Wainwright Lab (UC Davis) and the <a href="http://www.evovert.com/index.html">Price Lab</a> (Clemson University) collecting body shape data on 6,000 species of teleost fishes through an NSF-funded project. This project has included a team of over 20 undergraduates, four senior personnel, and two faculty members, and over 16,000 specimens. Our first paper describing the dataset and our work with our undergraduate team was published in <i>Integrative and Comparative Biology</i>; we found that fish width is the primary axis of morphological evolution across teleosts! We also wrote a Best Practices paper about our experience mentoring a diverse team of undergraduate over a yearlong Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience--you can find it in <i>Integrative Organismal Biology</i>.</p>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/flatfish_w.png" alt="" /></span><a href="https://www.adamsummers.org/">Adam Summers</a>, <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/acg/">Alice Gibb</a>, <a href="http://www.stacyfarina.com/">Stacy Farina</a>, and I studied the effect of size on burial success in flatfishes. We wanted to know how their ability to bury in the sand changes as the fish grows, and we used high speed video and photography to quantify burial performance. Our results suggest that both body size and substrate grain size can potentially limit the ability of flatfishes to bury: a very large fish (>150 cm) may move too slowly to fluidize all but the smallest substrate particles and some particles are simply too large for smaller individuals to fluidize. This paper was published in Journal of Experimental Biology: <a href="/pdfs/Corn et al 2018.pdf">read it here!</a></p>
                <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Sevengill.jpg" alt="" /></span> In my work on shark teeth, I explored structure, function, and evolution of shark teeth in two separate projects. At Cornell, Willy Bemis and I explored tooth morphology and development in sixgill and sevengill sharks. These sharks exhibit single-file tooth replacement, in which lost teeth are replaced without regard to the wear or loss status of adjacent tooth files. Their unique multicusped tooth morphology makes them a fascinating study system. In my work at Friday Harbor Labs, <a href="https://www.adamsummers.org/">Adam Summers</a>, <a href="http://www.stacyfarina.com/">Stacy Farina</a>, Jeff Brash, and I designed and built a dynamic testing device to test shark tooth performance under loading conditions experienced by prey. We found that variation in tooth shape affected cutting ability of teeth, and that there is likely a tradeoff between sharpness and longevity in shark teeth.
